# üåç SDG 13 ‚Äì Climate Action: Forecasting Carbon Emissions

## Overview
This project aims to forecast carbon emissions per capita using linear regression, contributing to UN SDG 13: Climate Action. By analyzing historical emissions data, we can predict future trends and inform policy decisions.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle ‚Äì CO‚ÇÇ Emissions by Country](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/co2-emissions-by-country)
- **Description**: Annual CO‚ÇÇ emissions per capita by country from 1960 to the present.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## ML Approach
1. Data preprocessing and feature selection
2. Train-test split (80/20)
3. Linear regression model training
4. Model evaluation using MAE and R¬≤ score
5. Visualization of actual vs predicted emissions

## Results
- **Mean Absolute Error**: [Insert value]
- **R¬≤ Score**: [Insert value]

## Ethical Considerations
Accurate forecasting of carbon emissions is crucial for effective climate policy. This model aids in understanding emission trends, supporting informed decision-making for sustainable development.
