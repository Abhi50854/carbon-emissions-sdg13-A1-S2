AI for Climate Action: Forecasting Carbon Emissions

Climate change poses a significant global challenge, 
and understanding carbon emission trends is vital for effective mitigation strategies. 
This project applies linear regression to forecast carbon emissions per capita, 
utilizing historical data from 1960 to the present.

By analyzing emissions trends, 
the model provides insights into future emission scenarios, 
aiding policymakers in developing informed strategies to combat climate change. 
The results underscore the importance of data-driven approaches in achieving SDG 13: Climate Action.

Ethical considerations include ensuring data accuracy, 
transparency in model development, and responsible use of predictions to inform policy decisions.
